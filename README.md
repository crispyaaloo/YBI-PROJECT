Twitter Data Analysis and Sentiment Insights

Project Overview:

This project focuses on extracting and analyzing tweets from the @CommBank Twitter account. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it cleans the data, performs sentiment analysis, and extracts valuable insights that can be leveraged for brand perception, customer sentiment tracking, and marketing strategy optimization.

Features and Functionality:

Twitter API Data Extraction:

Uses Twitter API v2 to fetch recent tweets from @CommBank.
Stores extracted data in a structured format.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Removes emojis, URLs, and special characters.
Converts text to lowercase and tokenizes tweets.
Performs stemming and lemmatization.
POS tagging for linguistic analysis.

Sentiment Analysis:

Uses TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity.
Categorizes sentiment into Positive, Neutral, and Negative.
Generates sentiment distribution statistics.

Data Export:

Stores cleaned and analyzed data in CSV format for further analysis.
Proposal for Business Insights
